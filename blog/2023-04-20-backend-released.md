ðŸš€ The dev team of [MwSpace llc](https://mwspace.com), is thrilled to announce the release of aka backend framework! ðŸŽ‰

We've been working hard on this powerful and intuitive backend framework, developed with ExpressJS to make it easy and efficient for you to develop web applications.

With aka backend, you can take advantage of our expressive routing system, which is managed through folder and file nomenclature. This approach makes it easy to organize and manage your codebase, even for large-scale applications.

We know that developers need speed and performance, which is why aka backend is optimized for efficiency, allowing you to create web applications quickly and easily. Plus, it's already production-ready, so you can get started right away without any extra setup.

:::tip

Just a small command, to get you started on something magnificent!

```bash
npx aka.create
# or
yarn aka.create
```

ðŸ’¬ We're excited to see what you'll create with aka backend, and we can't wait to hear your feedback!
