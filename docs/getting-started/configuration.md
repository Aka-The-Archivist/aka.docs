# Configuration

System configurations are an essential part of any application, allowing you to fine-tune and optimize your
application's behavior and performance. In the context of aka backend framework, system configurations are implemented
as a set of ES6-exported objects that specify the settings and parameters for your application.

> These configurations can be used to set up everything from the name and port of your application to the various
> middleware, providers, and policies that are used to manage and process incoming requests. By configuring these
> settings, you can create a customized and optimized environment for your application that meets your specific needs
> and requirements.

In aka backend framework, the system configurations are stored in the /config folder and are loaded automatically when
the application starts. By modifying these configurations, you can change the behavior and functionality of your
application in a variety of ways, making it easier to build and manage complex applications that meet your needs.
